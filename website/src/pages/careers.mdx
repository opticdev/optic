[Optic](/) is building a modern and developer-friendly version control workflow for APIs. Our open source tool automatically documents existing APIs, detects breaking changes, and help teams collaborate better through APIs. Imagine how amazing it would be if the tools we used for managing APIs (ie OpenAPI/Swagger) were as developer-friendly, easy to use, and ubiquitous, as the tools we use to manage our code (ie Git/GitHub) -- that's what we're building at Optic.

**If you join us, you’ll be an early team member helping to shape:**
1. our culture
2. product strategy, focus and direction
3. our business and growth strategy
4. engineering practices
5. the people that we hire

We're backed by **Boldstart**, **YCombinator** and the **founders of the developer tools you use daily**.

<Typography variant="h6" color="textPrimary" style={{marginBottom: 2}}>🚀 Let's make APIs friendly for all developers</Typography>

- What if every API (internal + external) had Stripe-style documentation?
- What if your team got all the benefits of OpenAPI, without having to write 10k line YAML files by hand?
- Why aren't API changes listed and discussed during Code Review?
- What if API consumers got notified about upcoming changes before they happened?

## Roles
We see recruiting as an exercise in Tolkien-esq world-building. We are creating our own slice of the universe where the rules are different, the cast of characters tear through challenges, support one another's growth, and lead compelling lives. We are not hiring engineers, or recruiting a team; we’re building the subset of the world we are proud and eager to spend most of our working hours each day.

- [Backend Engineer](https://boards.greenhouse.io/optic/jobs/4002851004)

## The team we are building

We are **big thinkers, but we remain focused on what matters most**.

We have a **healthy** **relationship with reality.** We experiment, we iterate, and we prefer to know the answers — even when they're hard to hear. This is in our DNA; a pivotal part of our founding has been running experiments and not hesitating to change course — even if we have to throw out cool tech.

We **prioritize and invest in the growth of individuals**, trusting the growth of each teammate will enhance our collective capabilities.

We remain patient, value resilience and **make decisions in service to our long-term goals.**

## Values

#### Take Ownership

People are at their most creative and fulfilled when they have agency and undertake meaningful responsibilities. We encourage you to take ownership for your work, the growth of your peers, the decisions your team makes, and the success of the customers you work with.

#### Practice Good Craftsmanship

As toolmakers, we have the privilege of measuring our impact by seeing the results of the products we help create. Do your best work and make sure you are proud of the parts of Optic for which you have taken responsibility.

#### Be a Good Human

Treat others with the respect, empathy and compassion every person deserves. Endeavor to leave everyone you interact with better than you found them.

#### Always Learn, Always Teach

Companies are just groups of people, and the surest way to raise our collective game is to focus on our own personal development. Take the time to learn from and to teach those around you. Hours spent reflecting on why something didn't work, researching how to take on the latest challenge, how you can improve, or teaching your teammates something new are never wasted.

#### Be Deliberate, Remain Patient

We're a patient bunch who know that the quality of decisions generally increases the longer the time horizon. Sometimes we have to say no to things that feel good in the moment because they bring us off-course. Practically, thinking long term doesn't mean over-optimizing or building everything to last. Rather it means confronting the nuance and being deliberate about the decisions we make and the tradeoffs they incur.
