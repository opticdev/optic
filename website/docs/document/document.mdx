> Get visibility into how your API works today. Optic learns your API's current behavior by observing traffic.

- How many endpoints are in your API?
- Is your current API specification accurate? complete? How do you know?

### Outcome

import TOCInline from '@theme/TOCInline';

<TOCInline toc={toc.slice(1)} />

## Capture API Traffic for Optic to Learn From

<ExpandDocs title="Comparing Capture Methods" defaultOpen={false}>

Optic captures real API traffic, and uses its observations to document the behavior of your API. When you're first on-boarding your API to Optic, we recommend using a mix of **Manual Traffic Collection** techniques and **Automated Traffic Collection** techniques. If you have good test coverage, or some other automated traffic sources (like Postman) already set up, you can use those to get the core of your API documented very quickly. Anything you don't have good tests for can be captured by making requests to your API manually or intercepting traffic from your Browsers to your running application (applicable to webapps).

<Tabs
defaultValue="manual"
values={[
  {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
  {label: 'Automated', value: 'automated'},
  {label: 'Passive (Live Environments)', value: 'passive'},
]}>
<TabItem value="manual">

  **Capture Traffic by using your API / App**:

  Setup an `api start` command for your framework. Requests to the API when its run with Optic's CLI will be captured

  <ShowAllFrameworks/>

  Intercept traffic from your browser's network tab. Just run `api intercept` and API calls you see in the Network Tab will be captured by Optic.

  <ShowAllBrowsers />
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="automated">

**Capture Traffic by running your API tests**

Setup an `api test` command for your framework:
<ShowAllFrameworks/>

Capture Traffic from your other API Tools:
<ShowAllTools />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="passive"> 
  
<LiveEnvironments />

## Document your existing API endpoints

Let's check if we've captured enough traffic to start documenting our API. Run `api status` -- we should see some new URLs to document:

```bash
$ api status

Computing API diffs... Done!
✓  No diffs observed for existing endpoints
   Undocumented URLs observed
      (use "api status --review" to start documenting them
          GET   /todos
        PATCH   /todos/mc6ttk3vv
         POST   /todos/
```

Nice work! Let's move to the next step: Documenting!
