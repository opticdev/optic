Runs an Optic Script with the current specification. Scripts are defined in the `optic.yml` file and allow you to build integration workflows with other tools via OpenAPI exports. Scripts may manage dependencies as well. It takes the name of the Script task to run and has an optional flag to install dependencies if necessary.

### Flags & Options

- `--install` will install any declared dependencies that are missing, using the provided command. By default, if a dependency is missing the Script task will stop and ask you to use the `--install` flag to proceed.

While running commands, the environment variables `OPENAPI_JSON` and `OPENAPI_YAML` are both available. They will contain the value of the file location of the JSON and YAML versions of the generated OpenAPI file. You can use this to populate parameters in your command.

### Examples

#### Run a script

```
api scripts
```

```
[optic] Found Script export-spec

[optic] Generated OAS files {...}/todo-js/.optic/generated/openapi.json
[optic] {...}/todo-js/.optic/generated/openapi.yaml
Running command: { command parameter from the script definition in optic.yml }
```

#### Install pre-requisites then run a script

For a script with dependencies, Optic will check that they are present before running the script. If not, they must be installed. The following example installs dependencies with the `install` parameter of the script configuration in `optic.yml`: 

```
api scripts export-spec --install
```

```
[optic] Found Script export-spec
Checking bin dependencies Requiring ["someprogram","anotherprogram"]... Missing dependencies
[optic] Some bin dependencies are missing ["anotherprogram"]. false
Running install command: { install command } ...
Running install command: { install command } ... Success!

[optic] Generated OAS files {...}/todo-js/.optic/generated/openapi.json
[optic] {...}/todo-js/.optic/generated/openapi.yaml
Running command: { command parameter from the script definition in optic.yml }

{ command output ... }
```

#### Errors

If dependencies are declared for the script with the `dependsOn` parameter, and the dependencies cannot be found, Optic will prompt you to run the scripts command with the `--install` flag. This will run the command in the `install` parameter provided in the script definition.

```
api scripts export-spec
```

```
[optic] Found Script export-spec
Checking bin dependencies Requiring ["someprogram","anotherprogram"]... Missing dependencies
[optic] Some bin dependencies are missing ["anotherprogram"]. Run the command again with the flag '--install' to install them
```
