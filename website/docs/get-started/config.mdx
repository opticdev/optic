title: Configure API Tasks

import {DemoStartCommandSetup} from '../../src/components/SetupType'


Optic documents your APIs as you build them by observing development traffic and learning your API's behavior. The CLI is constantly diffing your API’s behavior against its specification; ensuring every change to the API gets detected, documented and code reviewed by your team.

**How does Optic monitor local traffic?** Optic observes API and diffs API traffic in the background when you're building your API. All you have to do is start using API CLI to start your API + run your tests ie `api start` or `api run postman-tests`.

<div style={{display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'row', marginBottom: 15}}>
  <DemoStartCommandSetup />
</div>

```bash
$ api start
[optic] Optic is observing requests made to http://localhost:3005

> tododemo@0.1.0 server-start /Desktop/optic-demo-project
> babel-node server/server.js

```

### When you add Optic to your API:
- Changes to tracked endpoints (ie a new field, or a changed type) are detected by Optic. With one click, Optic will help you update the specification.
- Document new endpoints in seconds (just like "git add" source files).


### Configure `api start` alias
From your API project, run:
```
api init
```
> You can use the guided setup flow that `api init` opens, or follow along below.

Task Aliases are configured in the `optic.yml` file:
```yaml
name: "My API"
tasks:
  start:
     command: "node app.js"
     inboundUrl: http://localhost:4000
```

import Paper from '@material-ui/core/Paper'

The first task you should set up is `start`. When your run `api start` or `api run start` Optic will run the `command` to start your API on `inboundUrl`.

For the start task:
- `command` should start a long-running process, that binds to `localhost` on a specific `$PORT` (injected as an environment variable)
- `inboundUrl` should be set to where you start your API today

:::tip Make sure your API starts on $PORT
Optic assumes your API can be started on a specific port, which Optic assigns. To do this, Optic provides $PORT as an environment variable. You'll either need to map this variable to a flag your API framework looks for, or modify your code to look for the $PORT variable when starting up.

If you're using optic from within a non-bash environment (such as PowerShell), $PORT may need to be replaced with %PORT%
