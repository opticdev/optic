> Optic gives teams tools to ensure every API change gets reviewed, approved, and documented, before getting released.

- Do you know when your API changes?
- How does your team talk about, consider and review possible API changes?
- How do you make sure the API specification is updated when things change?

## Talking about Change
We have great tools for talking about code changes (Git, Line Diffs and PRs), but the tooling out here today does not make it easy to discuss API Changes. Instead of line diffs, of OpenAPI files, we need semantic diffs, detailing exactly what resources in our API have changed.

Like Git, Optic Specs include a history of every addition and change in your API since you ran `api init`. You can compare any two points in the history to understand how the API has changed.

### Real API Changelogs
Once you choose two versions of your API to compare, Optic's documentation viewer will render the changelog. We tried to build an experience similar to a Git compare page, but optimized for working with API changes.

Endpoints are highlighted based on the type of change that has happened:

- <strong style={{color: 'green'}}>Green</strong> indicates endpoints that have been added are highlighted in green.
- <strong style={{color: 'rgb(252,171,16)'}}>Yellow</strong> indicates changes have been made to an endpoint's shape.
- <strong style={{color: 'red'}}>Red</strong> endpoints have been deleted from the specification, and are no longer in the current version of the documentation.

- <strong style={{color: 'green'}}>Green</strong> indicates a field that has been added in the history compare timeframe.
- <strong style={{color: 'rgb(252,171,16)'}}>Yellow</strong> indicates changes have been made to a field, such as editing the field's type or metadata about the field (such as whether or not it is optional).
- <strong style={{color: 'red'}}>Red</strong> fields have been deleted from the specification, and are no longer in the current version of the documentation.
