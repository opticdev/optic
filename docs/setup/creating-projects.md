# Adding APIs
To begin using Optic with one of your repositories you have to create a new API project on Optic's webapp. 

1. First navigate to **Projects**
2. Click **+ Add API** and name your project
3. Optic will generate an **optic.yaml** file to configure your project. Add this to your repo.
4. Press **Finish**

The project will be created and Optic will redirect you to the new project's dashboard. 
- The dashboard displays a formatted version of your API Spec
- Tools for finding and resolving issues with your API Spec
- A branch/commit navigator so you can see how the API changes over time

In the next section "Using API Specs" you will learn how to have Optic read your code and upload the API Spec to Optic.
