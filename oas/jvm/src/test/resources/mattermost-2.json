      "name": "authentication",
      "description": "There are multiple ways to authenticate against the Mattermost API.\n\nAll examples assume there is a Mattermost instance running at http://localhost:8065.\n\n\nMake an HTTP POST to `your-mattermost-url.com/api/v4/users/login` with a JSON body indicating the user’s `login_id`, `password` and optionally the MFA `token`. The `login_id` can be an email, username or an AD/LDAP ID depending on the system's configuration.\n\n```\ncurl -i -d '{\"login_id\":\"someone@nowhere.com\",\"password\":\"thisisabadpassword\"}' http://localhost:8065/api/v4/users/login\n```\n\nNOTE: If you're running cURL on windows, you will have to change the single quotes to double quotes, and escape the inner double quotes with backslash, like below:\n\n```\ncurl -i -d \"{\\\"login_id\\\":\\\"someone@nowhere.com\\\",\\\"password\\\":\\\"thisisabadpassword\\\"}\" http://localhost:8065/api/v4/users/login\n```\n\nIf successful, the response will contain a `Token` header and a user object in the body.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nSet-Cookie: MMSID=hyr5dmb1mbb49c44qmx4whniso; Path=/; Max-Age=2592000; HttpOnly\nToken: hyr5dmb1mbb49c44qmx4whniso\nX-Ratelimit-Limit: 10\nX-Ratelimit-Remaining: 9\nX-Ratelimit-Reset: 1\nX-Request-Id: smda55ckcfy89b6tia58shk5fh\nX-Version-Id: developer\nDate: Fri, 11 Sep 2015 13:21:14 GMT\nContent-Length: 657\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\n\n{{user object as json}}\n```\n\nInclude the `Token` as part of the `Authorization` header on your future API requests with the `Bearer` method.\n\n```\ncurl -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer hyr5dmb1mbb49c44qmx4whniso' http://localhost:8065/api/v4/users/me\n```\n\nYou should now be able to access the API as the user you logged in as.\n\n\nUsing [personal access tokens](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/personal-access-tokens.html) is very similar to using a session token. The only real difference is that session tokens will expire, while personal access tokens will live until they are manually revoked by the user or an admin.\n\nJust like session tokens, include the personal access token as part of the `Authorization` header in your requests using the `Bearer` method. Assuming our personal access token is `9xuqwrwgstrb3mzrxb83nb357a`, we could use it as shown below.\n\n```\ncurl -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer 9xuqwrwgstrb3mzrxb83nb357a' http://localhost:8065/api/v4/users/me\n```\n\n\nMattermost has the ability to act as an [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) service provider.\n\nThe official documentation for [using your Mattermost server as an OAuth 2.0 service provider can be found here.](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/oauth-2-0-applications.html)\n\nFor an example on how to register an OAuth 2.0 app with your Mattermost instance, please see the [Mattermost-Zapier integration documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/integrations/zapier.html#register-zapier-as-an-oauth-2-0-application).\n"

    {
      "name": "WebSocket",
      "description": "In addition to the HTTP RESTful web service, Mattermost also offers a WebSocket event delivery system and some API functionality.\n\nTo connect to the WebSocket follow the standard opening handshake as [defined by the RFC specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-1.3) to the `/api/v4/websocket` endpoint of Mattermost.\n\n\nThe Mattermost WebSocket can be authenticated by cookie or through an authentication challenge. If you're authenticating from a browser and have logged in with the Mattermost API, your authentication cookie should already be set, this is how the Mattermost webapp authenticates with the WebSocket.\n\nTo authenticate with an authentication challenge, first connect the WebSocket and then send the following JSON over the connection:\n\n```\n{\n  \"seq\": 1,\n  \"action\": \"authentication_challenge\",\n  \"data\": {\n    \"token\": \"mattermosttokengoeshere\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf successful, you will receive a standard OK response from the webhook:\n\n```\n{\n  \"status\": \"OK\",\n  \"seq_reply\": 1\n}\n```\n\nOnce successfully authenticated, the server will pass a `hello` WebSocket event containing server version over the connection.\n\n\nWebSocket events are primarily used to alert the client to changes in Mattermost, such as delivering new posts or alerting the client that another user is typing in a channel.\n\nEvents on the WebSocket will have the form:\n\n```\n{\n  \"event\": \"hello\",\n  \"data\": {\n    \"server_version\": \"3.6.0.1451.1c38da627ebb4e3635677db6939e9195\"\n  },\n  \"broadcast\":{\n    \"omit_users\": null,\n    \"user_id\": \"ay5sq51sebfh58ktrce5ijtcwy\",\n    \"channel_id\": \"\",\n    \"team_id\": \"\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `event` field indicates the event type, `data` contains any data relevant to the event and `broadcast` contains information about who the event was sent to. For example, the above example has `user_id` set to \"ay5sq51sebfh58ktrce5ijtcwy\" meaning that only the user with that ID received this event broadcast. The `omit_users` field can contain an array of user IDs that were specifically omitted from receiving the event.\n\nThe list of Mattermost WebSocket events are:\n- added_to_team\n- authentication_challenge\n- channel_converted\n- channel_created\n- channel_deleted\n- channel_member_updated\n- channel_updated\n- channel_viewed\n- config_changed\n- delete_team\n- direct_added\n- emoji_added\n- ephemeral_message\n- group_added\n- hello\n- leave_team\n- license_changed\n- memberrole_updated\n- new_user\n- plugin_disabled\n- plugin_enabled\n- plugin_statuses_changed\n- post_deleted\n- post_edited\n- posted\n- preference_changed\n- preferences_changed\n- preferences_deleted\n- reaction_added\n- reaction_removed\n- response\n- role_updated\n- status_change\n- typing\n- update_team\n- user_added\n- user_removed\n- user_role_updated\n- user_updated\n- dialog_opened\n\n\nMattermost has some basic support for WebSocket APIs. A connected WebSocket can make requests by sending the following over the connection:\n\n```\n{\n  \"action\": \"user_typing\",\n  \"seq\": 2,\n  \"data\": {\n    \"channel_id\": \"nhze199c4j87ped4wannrjdt9c\",\n    \"parent_id\": \"\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is an example of making a `user_typing` request, with the purpose of alerting the server that the connected client has begun typing in a channel or thread. The `action` field indicates what is being requested, and performs a similar duty as the route in a HTTP API.\n\nThe `seq` or sequence number is set by the client and should be incremented with every use. It is used to distinguish responses to requests that come down the WebSocket. For example, a standard response to the above request would be:\n\n```\n{\n  \"status\": \"OK\",\n  \"seq_reply\": 2\n}\n```\n\nNotice `seq_reply` is 2, matching the `seq` of the original request. Using this a client can distinguish which request the response is meant for.\n\nIf there was any information to respond with, it would be encapsulated in a `data` field.\n\nIn the case of an error, the response would be:\n\n```\n{\n  \"status\": \"FAIL\",\n  \"seq_reply\": 2,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"id\": \"some.error.id.here\",\n    \"message\": \"Some error message here\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe list of WebSocket API actions is:\n- user_typing\n- get_statuses\n- get_statuses_by_ids\n\nTo see how these actions work, please refer to either the [Golang WebSocket driver](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/blob/master/model/websocket_client.go) or our [JavaScript WebSocket driver](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-redux/blob/master/src/client/websocket_client.js).\n"

      "name": "APIv3 Deprecation",
      "description": "Since Mattermost 4.6 released on January 16, 2018, API v3 has no longer been supported and it will be removed in Mattermost Server v5.0 on June 16, 2018. Follow these simple steps to migrate your integrations and apps to API v4. Otherwise your integrations may break once you upgrade to Mattermost 5.0\n\n1. Set your server's log level to `DEBUG` in **System Console > General > Logging > File Log Level** to print detailed logs for API requests.\n2. In **System Console > Logs**, search for requests hitting `/api/v3/` endpoints. Any requests hitting these endpoints are from integrations that should be migrated to API v4.\n  - For in-house or self-built integrations, update them to use v4 with the help of [this API reference](https://api.mattermost.com). Most v3 endpoints have direct counterparts in v4 and should be migrated easily.\n  - For third-party integrations, visit their homepage (on GitHub, GitLab, etc.). Check if they already have a version that uses the Mattermost v4 API. If they do not, consider opening an issue asking them if support is planned.\n3. Once all integrations have been migrated to API v4, review the server logs with log level set to `DEBUG`. Confirm no requests hit `/api/v3/` endpoints.\n4. Set **Allow use of API v3 endpoints** to `false` in **System Console > General > Configuration**, or set `EnableAPIv3` to `false` in `config.json`. This setting disables API v3 on your server. Any time a v3 endpoint is used, an error is logged in **System Console > Logs**.\n5. Set your server's log level back to `ERROR`. Use the error logs to help track down any remaining uses of API v3.\n\nBelow are the major changes made between v3 and v4:\n\n1. Endpoint URLs only require team IDs when necessary. For example, getting a channel by ID no longer requires a team ID in v4.\n2. Collection endpoints now generally return lists and include paging as part of the query string.\n3. User ID is now included in most user endpoints. This allows admins to modify other users through v4 endpoints.\n\nIf you have any questions about the API v3 deprecation, or about migrating from v3 to v4, [join our daily build server at pre-release.mattermost.com](https://pre-release.mattermost.com/signup_user_complete/?id=f1924a8db44ff3bb41c96424cdc20676) and ask questions in the [APIv4 channel](https://pre-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/apiv4).\n"
