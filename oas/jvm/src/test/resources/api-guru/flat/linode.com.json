    "description" : "# Introduction\nThe Linode API provides the ability to programmatically manage the full\nrange of Linode products and services.\n\nThis reference is designed to assist application developers and system\nadministrators.  Each endpoint includes descriptions, request syntax, and\nexamples using standard HTTP requests. Response data is returned in JSON\nformat.\n\n\nThis document was generated from our OpenAPI Specification.  See the\n[OpenAPI website](https://www.openapis.org) for more information.\n\n[Download the Linode OpenAPI Specification](/api/v4/openapi.yaml)\n\n\n# Changelog\n\n[View our Changelog](/changelog) to see release\nnotes on all changes made to our API.\n\n# Access and Authentication\n\nSome endpoints are publicly accessible without requiring authentication.\nAll endpoints affecting your Account, however, require either a Personal\nAccess Token or OAuth authentication (when using third-party\napplications).\n\n## Personal Access Token\n\nThe easiest way to access the API is with a Personal Access Token (PAT)\ngenerated from the\n[Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/profile/tokens).\n\nAll scopes for the OAuth security model (defined below) apply to this\nsecurity model as well.\n\n### Authentication\n\n| Security Scheme Type: | HTTP |\n|-----------------------|------|\n| **HTTP Authorization Scheme** | bearer |\n\n## OAuth\n\nThe OAuth workflow is a three-step process to authenticate a User before an\napplication can start making API calls on the User's behalf. If all you need\nis a Personal Access Token, feel free to skip ahead to the next section.\n\nFirst, the User visits the application's website and is directed to log with\nLinode. The User is then redirected to Linode's authentication server and\npresented the scope levels the application is requesting. Once the User\naccepts the request for access, we redirect them back to the application's\nspecified redirect URI with an access code.\n\nOnce the User has logged in to Linode and you have received an exchange code,\nyou will need to exchange that access code for an Authorization token. You\ndo this by making an HTTP POST request to the following address:\n\n```\nhttps://login.linode.com/oauth/token\n```\n\nMake this request as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or as\n`multipart/form-data` and include the following parameters in the POST body:\n\n| PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| client_id | Your app's client ID |\n| client_secret | Your app's client secret |\n| code | The code you just received from the redirect |\n\nYou'll get a reponse like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scope\": \"linodes:read_write\",\n  \"access_token\": \"03d084436a6c91fbafd5c4b20c82e5056a2e9ce1635920c30dc8d81dc7a6665c\"\n  \"token_type\": \"bearer\",\n  \"expires_in\": 7200,\n}\n```\n\nIncluded in the reponse is `access_token`. With this token, you can proceed to make\nauthenticated HTTP requests to the API by adding this header to each request:\n\n```\nAuthorization: Bearer 03d084436a6c91fbafd5c4b20c82e5056a2e9ce1635920c30dc8d81dc7a6665c\n```\n\n### Authentication\n\n| Security Scheme Type: | Oauth2 |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| **AuthorizationCode Oauth Flow** |  **Authorization URL:** https://login.linode.com/oauth/authorize<br />**Token URL:** https://login.linode.com/oauth/token<br />**Scopes:**<br /><ul><li>`account:read_only` - Allows access to GET information about your Account.</li><li>`account:read_write` - Allows access to all endpoints related to your Account.</li><li>`domains:read_only` - Allows access to GET Domains on your Account.</li><li>`domains:read_write` - Allows access to all Domain endpoints.</li><li>`events:read_only` - Allows access to GET your Events.</li><li>`events:read_write` - Allows access to all endpoints related to your Events.</li><li>`images:read_only` - Allows access to GET your Images.</li><li>`images:read_write` - Allows access to all endpoints related to your Images.</li><li>`ips:read_only` - Allows access to GET your ips.</li><li>`ips:read_write` - Allows access to all endpoints related to your ips.</li><li>`linodes:read_only` - Allows access to GET Linodes on your Account.</li><li>`linodes:read_write` - Allow access to all endpoints related to your Linodes.</li><li>`longview:read_only` - Allows access to GET your Longview Clients.</li><li>`longview:read_write` - Allows access to all endpoints related to your Longview Clients.</li><li>`nodebalancers:read_only` - Allows access to GET NodeBalancers on your Account.</li><li>`nodebalancers:read_write` - Allows access to all NodeBalancer endpoints.</li><li>`stackscripts:read_only` - Allows access to GET your StackScripts.</li><li>`stackscripts:read_write` - Allows access to all endpoints related to your StackScripts.</li><li>`volumes:read_only` - Allows access to GET your Volumes.</li><li>`volumes:read_write` - Allows access to all endpoints related to your Volumes.</li></ul><br />|\n\n# Requests\n\nRequests must be made over HTTPS to ensure transactions are encrypted. The\nfollowing Request methods are supported:\n\n| METHOD | USAGE |\n|--------|-------|\n| GET    | Retrieves data about collections and individual resources. |\n| POST   | For collections, creates a new resource of that type. Also used to perform actions on action endpoints. |\n| PUT    | Updates an existing resource. |\n| DELETE | Deletes a resource. This is a destructive action. |\n\n\n# Responses\n\nActions will return one following HTTP response status codes:\n\n| STATUS  | DESCRIPTION |\n|---------|-------------|\n| 200 OK  | The request was successful. |\n| 204 No Content | The server successfully fulfilled the request and there is no additional content to send. |\n| 400 Bad Request | You submitted an invalid request (missing parameters, etc.). |\n| 401 Unauthorized | You failed to authenticate for this resource. |\n| 403 Forbidden | You are authenticated, but don't have permission to do this. |\n| 404 Not Found | The resource you're requesting does not exist. |\n| 429 Too Many Requests | You've hit a rate limit. |\n| 500 Internal Server Error | Please [open a Support Ticket](#operation/createTicket). |\n\n# Errors\n\nSuccess is indicated via [Standard HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).\n`2xx` codes indicate success, `4xx` codes indicate a request error, and\n`5xx` errors indicate a server error. A\nrequest error might be an invalid input, a required parameter being omitted,\nor a malformed request. A server error means something went wrong processing\nyour request. If this occurs, please\n[open a Support Ticket](#operation/createTicket)\nand let us know. Though errors are logged and we work quickly to resolve issues,\nopening a ticket and providing us with reproducable steps and data is always helpful.\n\nThe `errors` field is an array of the things that went wrong with your request.\nWe will try to include as many of the problems in the response as possible,\nbut it's conceivable that fixing these errors and resubmitting may result in\nnew errors coming back once we are able to get further along in the process\nof handling your request.\n\n\nWithin each error object, the `field` parameter will be included if the error\npertains to a specific field in the JSON you've submitted. This will be\nomitted if there is no relevant field. The `reason` is a human-readable\nexplanation of the error, and will always be included.\n\n# Pagination\n\nResource lists are always paginated. The response will look similar to this:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"data\": [ ... ],\n    \"page\": 1,\n    \"pages\": 3,\n    \"results\": 300\n}\n```\n\nPages start at 1. You may retrieve a specific page of results by adding\n`?page=x` to your URL (for example, `?page=4`). Page sizes default to 100,\nand can be set to return between 25 and 100. Page size can be set using\n`?page_size=x`.\n\n# Filtering and Sorting\n\nCollections are searchable by fields they include, marked in the spec as\n`x-linode-filterable: true`. Filters are passed\nin the `X-Filter` header and are formatted as JSON objects. Here is a request\ncall for Linode Types in our \"standard\" class:\n\n```Shell\ncurl \"https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types\" \\\n  -H 'X-Filter: { \\\n    \"class\": \"standard\"\n  }'\n```\n\nThe filter object's keys are the keys of the object you're filtering,\nand the values are accepted values. You can add multiple filters by\nincluding more than one key. For example, filtering for \"standard\" Linode\nTypes that offer one vcpu:\n\n```Shell\n curl \"https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types\" \\\n  -H 'X-Filter: { \\\n    \"class\": \"standard\",\n    \"vcpus\": 1\n  }'\n```\n\nIn the above example, both filters are combined with an \"and\" operation.\nHowever, if you wanted either Types with one vcpu or Types in our \"standard\"\nclass, you can add an operator:\n\n```Shell\ncurl \"https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types\" \\\n  -H 'X-Filter: {\n    \"+or\": [\n      { \"vcpus\": 1 },\n      { \"class\": \"standard\" }\n    ]\n  }'\n```\n\nEach filter in the `+or` array is its own filter object, and all conditions\nin it are combined with an \"and\" operation as they were in the previous example.\n\nOther operators are also available. Operators are keys of a Filter JSON\nobject. Their value must be of the appropriate type, and they are evaluated\nas described below:\n\n| OPERATOR | TYPE   | DESCRIPTION                       |\n|----------|--------|-----------------------------------|\n| +and     | array  | All conditions must be true.       |\n| +or      | array  | One condition must be true.        |\n| +gt      | number | Value must be greater than number. |\n| +gte     | number | Value must be greater than or equal to number. |\n| +lt      | number | Value must be less than number. |\n| +lte     | number | Value must be less than or equal to number. |\n| +contains | string | Given string must be in the value. |\n| +neq      | string | Does not equal the value.          |\n| +order_by | string | Attribute to order the results by - must be filterable. |\n| +order    | string | Either \"asc\" or \"desc\". Defaults to \"asc\". Requires `+order_by`. |\n\nFor example, filtering for [Linode Types](#operation/getLinodeTypes)\nthat offer memory equal to or higher than 61440:\n\n```Shell\ncurl \"https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types\" \\\n  -H 'X-Filter: {\n    \"memory\": {\n      \"+gte\": 61440\n    }\n  }'\n```\n\nYou can combine and nest operators to construct arbitrarily-complex queries.\nFor example, give me all [Linode Types](#operation/getLinodeTypes)\nwhich are either `standard` or `highmem` class, and\nhave between 12 and 20 vcpus:\n\n```Shell\ncurl \"https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types\" \\\n  -H 'X-Filter: {\n    \"+or\": [\n      {\n        \"+or\": [\n          {\n            \"class\": \"standard\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"class\": \"highmem\"\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"+and\": [\n          {\n            \"vcpus\": {\n              \"+gte\": 12\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            \"vcpus\": {\n              \"+lte\": 20\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }'\n```\n\n# CLI (Command Line Interface)\n\nThe [Linode CLI](https://github.com/linode/linode-cli) allows you to easily\nwork with the API using intuitive and simple syntax. It requires a\n[Personal Access Token](#section/Personal-Access-Token)\nfor authentication, and gives you access to all of the features and functionality\nof the Linode API that are documented here with CLI examples.\n\nEndpoints that do not have CLI examples are currently unavailable through the CLI, but\ncan be accessed via other methods such as Shell commands and other third-party applications.\n",
