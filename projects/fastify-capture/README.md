# Fastify capture
Capture your Fastify test traffic to `.har` HTTP archive files.


## Installation
```
yarn add @useoptic/fastify-capture
npm install @useoptic/fastify-capture
```


## Setup
``` Typescript
import { fastifyCapture } form '@useoptic/fastify-capture'

if (env === 'test') {
  fastify.addHook('onSend', fastifyCapture({
    // Determines where the captured archives will be exported
    harOutputDir: 'har-capture',

    // Set to a number between 0 and 1 to sample traffic
    sampleRate: undefined
  }));
}
```

## Usage
The `optic` CLI uses the captured `.har` files to measure how much of your OpenAPI specification is covered by your tests ðŸª„
