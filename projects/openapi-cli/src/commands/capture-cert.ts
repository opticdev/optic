      console.log(`We take privacy seriously. You should understand how Optic's TLS capturing works:

The Optic proxy is a man-in-the-middle proxy that only runs on and logs data to your local machine. 
 
1. The 'capture' command assigns your system proxy settings when starting, and restores them upon exit. Most clients will respect those settings and route traffic through Optic.
2. The Optic proxy transparently routes all traffic to its destination, even traffic it can not read.
3. The Optic proxy is also a man-in-the-middle. It tries to read traffic to your API hostnames: i.e. localhost:3005 or https://api.example.com to learn and verify API behaviors

By default, there is no way for Optic to read any TLS traffic. If you want to use Optic to read TLS traffic, it will need a trusted CA Certification. This setup wizard will:

1. Generate a CA Certificate on your local machine (it will not phone it home)
2. Add that certificate to your trust chain 
3. Use that Cert to terminate TLS and log traffic from the target hostnames. 

If you do this, you are man-in-the-middling yourself. Optic will theoretically be able to see any TLS traffic when the 'capture' command is activated.
